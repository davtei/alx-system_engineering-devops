# Postmortem: Web App Downtime Incident Analysis

Issue Summary:

Duration of Outage: August 8, 2023, 09:00–13:00 (GMT)

Impact: The web application experienced downtime, affecting user experience. 50% of users reported slowed response time, while 25% experienced complete unresponsiveness. A total of 75% (approximately 125,000) users were impacted

Root Cause: The incident resulted from an overload on specific servers due to a configuration flaw on the load balancers. The misconfiguration emerged from recent systems upgrades.

Timeline:

09:00: Datadog monitors detected an increase in response time from select servers.
09:10: The engineering team received an alert regarding the server downtime.
09:30: User complaints and reports regarding the downtime began to pour in.
09:35: The performance of the database server was initially suspected as the cause.
09:40: Logs were collected from the backend servers for analysis.
09:45: Monitors indicated that certain servers were receiving a disproportionate number of requests.
10:10: Thorough testing and retesting of backend server configurations were conducted.
11:50: The incident was escalated to senior DevOps engineers and a senior system administrator.
12:30: A misconfiguration in the load balancers was pinpointed as the root cause.
12:45: The load balancers were meticulously reconfigured to evenly distribute the load across all web application servers.
Root Cause and Resolution:

The server downtime was rooted in the improper configuration of the load balancers following the integration of newly acquired servers during a recent systems upgrade. The misconfigured load balancers led to an imbalanced distribution of load among backend servers, triggering an overload on certain servers.

To resolve the issue, the load balancers were reconfigured to ensure a balanced distribution of requests, alleviating the strain on specific servers.

Lessons Learned and Key Takeaways:

Effective Communication: Immediate, clear, and coordinated communication among teams is essential during incidents to minimize response times and keep stakeholders informed.
Comprehensive Monitoring: Automated monitoring systems should be comprehensive and include metrics for load distribution, server performance, and response times.
Incident Response Training: Ongoing training should be conducted to ensure all team members are well-equipped to execute their roles effectively during incidents.
Change Management and Review: Rigorous review processes should be established before integrating new infrastructure components, and changes should be meticulously communicated and validated across teams.
Preventive and Corrective Measures:

Automated Monitoring Enhancement:
Implement monitoring for load distribution to detect uneven connection request loads.
Set alert thresholds based on real-time connection counts to identify load imbalances promptly.
2. Load Balancer Testing:

Design and conduct rigorous load testing scenarios to assess load balancer behavior under various stress conditions.
Analyze test results to ensure effective load distribution.
3. Configuration Review and Audits:

Establish a regular schedule for configuration reviews to detect and rectify misconfigurations before they impact production.
Conduct comprehensive audits of load balancer configurations to ensure optimal performance.
4. Enhanced Communication Protocols:

Develop clear communication protocols to ensure timely and accurate information dissemination among teams during incidents.
5. Change Management Reinforcement:

Strengthen change management procedures to include thorough validation and cross-functional communication before integrating new infrastructure components.
6. Incident Response Training Plan:

Develop a comprehensive training plan that includes regular drills and cross-training to improve the team’s ability to respond effectively to incidents.
Incorporating these insights and recommendations into our processes will enhance our ability to respond to incidents promptly, prevent their recurrence, and ensure a more resilient and reliable web application environment.

By conducting this postmortem analysis, we are committed to continuous improvement and ensuring that the lessons learned from this incident contribute to the enhancement of our systems, processes, and overall reliability.
