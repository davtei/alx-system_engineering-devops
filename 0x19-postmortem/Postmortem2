# Postmortem: The Great Web App Adventure ðŸš€

**Issue Summary:**
**Duration of the Great Expedition:** August 8, 2023, 09:00 - 13:00 (GMT)
**Total Adventurers:** Around 10,000 brave souls
**Impact:** Our web application decided to take a coffee break, leaving 50% of users with a "Hold on, I'm thinking!" message and rendering 25% of them lost in the abyss of unresponsiveness.

**Root Cause:** Our code wizards discovered that a mischievous goblin called "Misconfiguritis" had cast its spell on our load balancers. This fiendish prank was an accidental byproduct of recent upgrades to our mystical systems.

**Timeline of the Epic Saga:**
- **09:00:** Our all-seeing crystal balls, aka Datadog monitors, caught wind of unusual response times from specific servers.
- **09:10:** Our gallant engineering team received the Bat-Signal â€“ an alert for server downtime.
- **09:30:** User ravens brought in complaints from the farthest corners of the realm.
- **09:35:** The sorcerer's apprentice blamed the enchanted database for the chaos.
- **09:40:** Mages collected logs from the realm's backend realms for analysis.
- **09:45:** The monitors revealed that some servers were receiving an unfair share of user wishes.
- **10:10:** The "trial-and-error" potion was brewed as backend incantations were tested and retested.
- **11:50:** Alas, the Council of Elders (aka senior DevOps engineers) was summoned to tackle the dark enchantment.
- **12:30:** The wise elder sorcerers uncovered the misconfiguration riddle in the load balancers.
- **12:45:** With chants and careful gestures, the load balancers were reconfigured to spread the magical load evenly across all servers.

**The Enchanted Chronicles and Solutions:**
The tale was woven from the strands of misconfigured load balancers, a side effect of merging new sorcerous servers into the realm. These unbalanced scales led to a dance of chaos among our loyal servers.
To mend the rift in the weave, the load balancers' spells were re-cast, ensuring a harmonious distribution of burdens among the servers.

**Lessons from the Mystic Woods:**
- **Gryffindor-level Communication:** Swift, precise, and synchronized communication saved the day.
- **Oracle-Level Monitoring:** Automated sentinels armed with magical metrics shall watch over load distribution, server vigor, and response times.
- **Adventurer Bootcamp:** Regular training for our valiant team members to wield their magical skills with grace during dark times.
- **Sorcery and Change Dance:** Rituals of validation and communication before introducing new magical artifacts into the mix.

**Magical Shields and Chants for the Future:**
1. **Enchanted Monitoring Upgrade:**
   - Equip the sentinels to monitor load distribution for early detection of mischievous goblins.
   - Set crystal alerts to sparkle when servers receive more quests than their hearts can bear.

2. **Goblin Bashing Tests:**
   - Conjure and execute enchanting load tests to scrutinize load balancer behavior under extreme duress.
   - Decode test scrolls to glean insights into the ways of the load balancers.

3. **Charm and Incantation Audits:**
   - Establish regular gatherings to peer into the depths of configurations and exorcise misconfigurations before they cast shadows.
   - Appoint wise wizards to scrutinize load balancer spells for optimal performance.

4. **Raven Messaging Mastery:**
   - Craft the most eloquent ravens for precise and timely inter-team communiques during epic quests.

5. **Ritual of Change Reinforcement:**
   - Infuse the change management incantation with triple-check validations and cross-team recitations before welcoming new magical entities.

6. **Masterclass in Wizardry:**
   - Craft an ongoing masterclass for our magical scholars to keep their spells sharp and their wands ready for action.

By weaving these magical threads into our tapestry, we pledge to continue our quest for reliability, resilience, and a web application that will brave the most treacherous of storms unscathed.

In the enchanted spirit of DevOps, let this tale be a beacon of light guiding us towards continuous improvement.
